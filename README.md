### Hey, my name is Dustin Clark
I work as a Controls Engineering Technologist and I am constantly learning and working 
on my own Software Development projects! C++ is the language I like the most; however, I am open to learning more 
languages as needed to become a better software developer.
  
I am always open for learning and Ideas!

Thanks
