### Hey, my name is Dustin Clark
I am a Controls Engineering Technologist by day and an **Aspiring Software Developer** by night. I started learning software development and instantly fell in love with it. I started with C++ and keep learning everyday taking courses and expanding my knowledge and experience. I am currently learning more about Parallel Programming and Concurrency and I am constantly working on my own projects. This is fun!    
  
I am always open for learning and Ideas!

Aspiring Dev!
