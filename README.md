### Hey, my name is Dustin Clark
I am a Software Developer. I started learning software development and instantly fell in love with it. I started with C++ and keep learning everyday taking courses and expanding my knowledge and experience. I am currently learning more about Parallel Programming and Concurrency and I am constantly working on my own projects. The main project that I am working on is JADE_ITE2D! This is a simple 2D game engine that I am creating as a personal project. It is not yet public, but it will be soon! This is fun!    
  
I am always open for learning and Ideas!
