# About
I am currently a Software Developer. I am constantly trying to improve my skills every day working on my own projects.
I am also a father to four wonderful children. So if I am not working, I am having a good time with my children, playing games, cooking, skateboarding, etc.

I also have a small YouTube Channel that I do for fun and educational purposes. 
We are currenlty building a 2D Game Engine called [SCION 2D](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3HUvSWOJR7XRDwVVQqqWO-zyyscb8L-v)
