### Hey, my name is Dustin Clark
I am a Software Developer. I started learning software development and instantly fell in love with it. The programming language I started with was C++. I truely enjoy this language and keep learning everyday by taking courses and expanding my knowledge and experience. I am constantly working on my own projects. The main project that I am working on is SCION2D! This is a simple 2D game engine that I am creating as a personal project on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@JADE-iteGames) channel.    
  
I am always open for learning and Ideas!
