### Hey, my name is Dustin Clark
I work as a Controls Engineering Technologist and I am constantly learning and working 
on my own Software Development projects!

Since 2020 I have been taking courses and creating programs as a self-taught developer, and let me tell you, it has been a wonderful journey so far.

Some of the tech stack that I have been using/learning are as follows:
  * c++ 
  * lua
  * html
  * css
  
### What I am currently working on:
  I am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in c++ and finishing the Zelda Clone that I have been working on. 
  
I am always open for learning and Ideas!

Thanks
